# AI Assurance Sandbox

## ML Interpretability & Assurance
Concurrent Technologies Corporation (CTC) is performing research and development into the emerging fields of ML 
interpretability & assurance to better understand the trade-offs between model utility, privacy, security, and 
interpretability. In this research, we leverage novel techniques to understand model processing and how to 
contextualize model output with additional information. This repo demonstrates some of the tools and techniques that 
our analysis use to better interpret modern deep neural networks.
